Module 14 Challenge:

For this challenge we were tasked with creating an interactive dashboard that would explore the "Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset"

To do so we:
- First downloaded the starter files and then created a D3 library to read the samples.json file.
- Then we used that data to create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu, that would display the top 10 OTUs:
- sample_values as the values for the bar chart
- otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart
- otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart

- Finally we used this same data set and created a bubble chart:
- otu_ids for the x values
- sample_values for the y values
- sample_values for the marker size
- otu_ids for the marker color
- otu_labels for the text values
